This is the Blender files loading module of the yoyEngine, an in house engine created by Yoy Simulators that uses Ogre3D as its main renderer.
This module were heavily inspired by gamekit/ogrekit
We are sharing this code with the purpose of creating a plugin for Ogre that loads Blender files directly with the help of the community.
At this stage it need lots of work since its just a copy-paste of files from our engine and it wont compile.
Please feel free to do whatever you want with this code! enjoy
